```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(mytablepkg)
```

## Why an article

I can write and article available on pkgdown site but not needed for CRAN - won't show up on CRAN.

### Example using `mtcars` dataset

```{r}
cont_table(varlist = c("mpg", "wt"), data = mtcars)
```
